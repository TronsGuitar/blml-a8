Short Answer:
This code defines an internal helper class used by the VB.NET runtime to provide backwards compatibility for VB6-style binary file operations (e.g., Open ... For Binary, Get, Put, Lock, Unlock, Seek, and Input). It helps maintain expected VB6 behavior in VB.NET applications that were upgraded from VB6.

Detailed Explanation:
In the early days of VB.NET, many projects were being migrated from VB6 to VB.NET. Because VB6 and VB.NET handle file I/O and string operations differently, Microsoft introduced classes in the Microsoft.VisualBasic.CompilerServices namespace to emulate VB6’s runtime behaviors. This allows legacy VB6 code—especially file-handling code—to continue working as intended after migration.

Here’s what the code is doing and why it exists:

1. Backwards Compatibility Layer:
The class VB6BinaryFile inherits from VB6RandomFile and is marked as Friend and EditorBrowsableState.Never. These attributes suggest it is not intended for direct use in typical VB.NET code. Instead, it’s an internal runtime support class. The comments emphasize that changes should be made with caution to avoid breaking compatibility with existing VB6-compiled applications that rely on its old behaviors.


2. Mimicking VB6 Binary Mode File I/O:
In VB6, you might open files using syntax like Open "filename" For Binary As #1. Methods like Get, Put, Lock, Unlock, Seek, and Loc were then used to manipulate data. This code provides similar interfaces:

Get/Put: Reads and writes data to/from the file, just like the VB6 Get and Put statements.

Lock/Unlock: Manages file or record locking in a manner consistent with VB6 semantics.

Seek and Loc: Manages the current read/write position to replicate VB6’s approach to file positioning.

Input: Supports the Input statement, which was used to read data from a file into variables, following VB6’s logic for parsing strings, numbers, and dates.



3. Adapting to Binary Mode Specifics:
The class sets m_lRecordLen = -1 to indicate that it’s dealing with raw bytes (i.e., binary data) rather than fixed-length records. This aligns with VB6’s Binary mode concept. The Lock and Unlock methods handle situations where record length is not fixed, defaulting to 1 byte when m_lRecordLen = -1.


4. String and Data Parsing:
In VB6, reading text or other types of data from a binary file might require special parsing. The InputStr() function, for example, attempts to replicate VB6’s behavior of parsing fields (including quoted strings) and handling whitespace just like VB6’s Input statement.


5. Error Handling Consistent with VB6:
The code attempts to throw exceptions or produce errors that closely match what VB6 would have done. For instance, if the file was not opened for read access, a NullReferenceException is thrown to mimic the VB6 runtime error behavior.



In Summary:
The entire purpose of this code is to let code originally written for VB6’s binary file operations continue functioning under VB.NET without rewriting all the file handling logic. It’s essentially a compatibility layer that preserves the VB6 runtime semantics.

Below is a direct, line-by-line rewrite of the given VB.NET code into C#. This rewrite attempts to preserve the logic, structure, and comments of the original code as much as possible. Note that some parts rely on VB-specific runtime methods and namespaces (Microsoft.VisualBasic.CompilerServices) and their behavior (such as GetResourceString, VbMakeException, FIN_QSTRING, etc.). To fully compile this in C#, you’d need to provide equivalent implementations or references for those VB runtime functionalities, or re-implement their logic.

Because the original code is part of an internal VB runtime infrastructure, it uses functions and constants that don’t have direct C# equivalents. In a real migration scenario, you would replace these calls with appropriate .NET methods, or remove them if you no longer need VB6 compatibility behavior.

Key Differences in the Rewrite:

Constructors, methods, and properties are translated to C# syntax.

Attributes are placed in [ ] rather than < >.

Friend in VB is internal in C#.

Overrides in VB is override in C#.

Optional parameters in VB are handled by providing default parameter values in C#.

VB-specific runtime functions (e.g., BooleanType.FromString, ByteType.FromObject, etc.) are placeholders. In a real scenario, you’d replace them with equivalent parsing or conversion logic.

Error handling uses standard .NET exceptions, just like in VB, but now in C# syntax.

String and character operations are translated as directly as possible.

Notes:

GetResourceString, ResID, and VbMakeException: These are VB runtime internals for resource localization and VB-specific exception creation. In a pure C# context, you would either implement your own resource handling or remove these calls.

BooleanType.FromString, ByteType.FromObject, ...: These are VB runtime conversion utilities. For C#, replace these with bool.Parse, Convert.ToByte(...), Convert.ToInt16(...), etc. Similarly, DateType.FromString can be replaced with DateTime.Parse.

m_file, m_sr, m_Encoding, FIN_QSTRING, FIN_STRING, lchDoubleQuote, SkipWhiteSpaceEOF(), ReadInField(), and GetFixedLengthString(): These members and methods are from the base class (VB6RandomFile) or other parts of the VB runtime. You would need to provide equivalents for them in C# or adapt the logic accordingly.

OpenAccess, OpenShare, OpenMode, and VariantType: These enums and related logic come from VB runtime concepts. In C#, you’d define or adapt these enumerations as needed.


This rewrite is a starting point. In practice, you’d refactor and modernize this code to use standard C# I/O (e.g., FileStream, BinaryReader, BinaryWriter), remove VB-specific utilities, and handle encoding, conversions, and localization with standard .NET methods.
