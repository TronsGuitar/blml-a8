                  Dynamic Code-Linked Requirements (DCLR)

Abstract

   This document specifies a format and process for Dynamic Code-Linked
   Requirements (DCLR), a method for managing software requirements in
   a way that directly links them to the codebase and enables
   semi-automated code modification and regeneration.  This approach
   is intended for enterprise environments with continuous integration
   and delivery pipelines, where rapid iteration and adaptation to
   changing requirements are crucial.

1.  Introduction

   Traditional software requirements specifications (SRS) often become
   out of sync with the evolving codebase.  This document proposes
   Dynamic Code-Linked Requirements (DCLR) as a method to mitigate this
   problem.  DCLR documents are designed to be parsed and processed by
   software tools, enabling automated code extraction, modification, and
   regeneration based on changes to the requirements.  This approach
   aims to improve traceability, reduce manual coding effort, and
   facilitate rapid adaptation to changing business needs.  This system
   is *not* intended to replace all traditional requirements
   documentation, but rather to augment it for specific, code-centric
   aspects of a project.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   *   **DCLR Document:**  The document containing the dynamic,
       code-linked requirements.
   *   **Generator:** The software tool that parses the DCLR document and
       performs code extraction, modification, and regeneration.
   *   **Code Snippet:**  A portion of code (function, class, block)
       directly related to a specific requirement.
   *   **Modification Instructions:**  A structured set of commands
       within the DCLR document that specify how to change the code.
   *   **Extraction Logic:**  Code (within the DCLR document) that defines
       how to locate and extract a specific code snippet.
   *   **Regeneration Logic:** Code (within the DCLR document) that
       defines how to re-insert modified code back into the codebase.
   *   **XMI:** XML Metadata Interchange, a standard for representing UML
       models.

3.  DCLR Document Format

   A DCLR document MUST be a plain text file, formatted using Markdown
   [MARKDOWN] for human readability and structured conventions for
   machine parsing.

   3.1.  Header/Metadata

   The header MUST contain the following fields:

   *   `Document ID`:  A unique identifier (string). REQUIRED.
   *   `Document Version`:  A version number (e.g., semantic versioning). REQUIRED.
   *   `Git Repository`:  The URL of the Git repository. REQUIRED.
   *   `Branch`: The target branch. REQUIRED.
   *   `Last Updated`:  A timestamp. REQUIRED.
   *   `Author(s)`:  A list of authors. REQUIRED.
   *   `Status`: The document status (e.g., Draft, Approved). REQUIRED.
   *   `Related Documents`:  Links to related documents (OPTIONAL).

   3.2.  Requirement Sections

   Each requirement MUST be a separate section, structured as follows:

   3.2.1.  Requirement Identification

   *   `Requirement ID`:  A unique identifier (string). REQUIRED.

   3.2.2.  Descriptive Fields

   *   `Title`:  A short descriptive title (string). REQUIRED.
   *   `Description`:  A human-readable explanation (text). REQUIRED.
   *   `Type`:  Requirement category (e.g., Functional, Security). REQUIRED.
   *   `Priority`:  Priority level (e.g., High, Medium, Low). REQUIRED.
   *   `Status`:  Requirement status (e.g., Implemented, Rejected). REQUIRED.

   3.2.3.  Source Code References

   This section links the requirement to the codebase.  It MUST contain:

   *   `File Paths`:  A list of relevant file paths (strings). REQUIRED.
   *   `Code Snippet Identifiers`:  Identifiers to locate code snippets
       within the files.  These MUST follow a predefined convention
       (e.g., `# FUNCTION: name`, `# CLASS: name`, `# SECTION: name`).
       REQUIRED.
   *   `Extraction Logic`:  Executable code (e.g., Python) defining how
       to extract the snippet.  OPTIONAL, but RECOMMENDED for complex
       cases.
   *  `Regeneration Logic`:  Executable code (e.g., Python) defining how
       to re-insert modified code. OPTIONAL, but RECOMMENDED for complex
       cases.

   3.2.4.  Modification Instructions

   This section contains instructions for modifying the code.  It MUST
   use a predefined, structured format. Examples include:

   *   `REPLACE FUNCTION <name> WITH <new_code>`
   *   `ADD PARAMETER <param> TO FUNCTION <name>`
   *   `REMOVE LINE <number>`
   *   `INSERT <new_code> BEFORE LINE <number>`

   The specific syntax of these instructions is implementation-dependent,
   but MUST be clearly defined.

   3.2.5.  UML Integration (Optional)

   This section MAY include references to UML diagrams in XMI format:

   *   `XMI References`: Paths to XMI files.
   *   `Image Links`:  Links to rendered images of the diagrams.
   *  `Embedded UML DSL`: A simplified textual representation of the UML (OPTIONAL).
    *   `Modification Instructions`: Instructions referencing UML elements.

   3.3.  Dependencies Section (Optional)

   This section MAY list external dependencies.

   3.4.  Testing Considerations

   This section SHOULD outline testing requirements related to the
   defined requirements.

4.  Code Generation and Modification Process

   The process of using a DCLR document to modify code involves the
   following steps:

   4.1.  Parsing

   The Generator MUST parse the DCLR document, extracting all relevant
   information.

   4.2.  Code Extraction

   The Generator MUST use the `File Paths`, `Code Snippet Identifiers`,
   and `Extraction Logic` to extract the relevant code snippets from
   the codebase.

   4.3.  Modification Application

   The Generator MUST apply the `Modification Instructions` to the
   extracted code.

   4.4.  Code Regeneration

   The Generator MUST use the `Regeneration Logic` (or default logic
   based on snippet identifiers) to re-insert the modified code into
   the original files.  The Generator MUST ensure that the regenerated
   code maintains the original code's formatting style.

   4.5.  Version Control Integration

   The Generator SHOULD create a new branch in the Git repository,
   commit the changes with a descriptive message (referencing the
   Requirement ID), and create a pull request. Direct commits to protected
   branches (e.g., `main`, `develop`) are STRONGLY DISCOURAGED.

5.  Security Considerations

   Allowing automated code modification based on a document introduces
   security risks.  Access to DCLR documents MUST be strictly
   controlled.  Code review (via pull requests) is ESSENTIAL before
   merging changes into production branches.  The Generator itself MUST
   be thoroughly tested and secured to prevent malicious code injection.
   The execution environment for the `Extraction Logic` and
   `Regeneration Logic` MUST be sandboxed to prevent unintended side
   effects.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

**Key Changes and Explanations in the RFC Format:**

*   **Formal Structure:** The document now follows the standard RFC structure (Abstract, Status, Copyright, Table of Contents, numbered sections).
*   **RFC 2119 Keywords:**  The use of MUST, SHOULD, etc., adds a level of formality and precision to the requirements.
*   **Terminology Section:**  Clearly defines key terms.
*   **Security Considerations:** A dedicated section highlights the security implications of this approach.
*   **Informative References:** Includes links to relevant specifications (Markdown and RFC 2119).
*   **IANA Considerations:**  States that no IANA actions are required (which is likely the case for this type of document).
*   **"Intended Status: Informational":**  This RFC is presented as an informational document, describing a proposed approach rather than a formal standard.  If this were to become a widely adopted standard, it might be submitted as a "Standards Track" RFC.
* **Target Audience**: While not explicitly stated. It is implied that this is for enterprise software development.

**Next Steps:**

*   **Refine the Modification Instructions:** The RFC mentions a "predefined, structured format" for modification instructions but doesn't specify it in detail.  A separate document or appendix could define a formal grammar for these instructions.
*   **Prototype Implementation:** Building a prototype generator would be crucial to validate the feasibility and identify practical challenges.
*   **Community Feedback:**  Sharing this draft RFC with the software development community (e.g., on relevant forums, mailing lists) would solicit feedback and improve the proposal.
* **UML Section Detailing**: Further details could be provided about the UML specific commands.

This RFC provides a solid foundation for discussing and potentially standardizing the concept of Dynamic Code-Linked Requirements. It frames the idea in a formal, well-understood context, making it easier to communicate and evaluate.
