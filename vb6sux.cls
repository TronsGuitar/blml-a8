' 1. Keywords as Variable Names
' VB6 allows many keywords to be used as variable names if they're not reserved
Dim Error As Integer  ' "Error" is both a keyword and can be a variable name
Error = 100           ' Ambiguous: Is this setting the Error system object or the variable?

' 2. Let keyword ambiguity
Dim Let As Integer    ' Let can be both a keyword and variable name
Let Let = 10         ' Highly ambiguous: Let statement or assignment to Let variable?
Let = 20             ' More ambiguity: Is this Let = 20 or implicit Let Let = 20?

' 3. Type suffix character ambiguity
Dim A%               ' Integer using type suffix

' 4. Default Property Ambiguity
' Assuming we have a form with a textbox named "Text1"

MyString = "Hello" & _
"World"              ' Is this one line or two? VB6 treats differently

' 6. Parameter Passing Ambiguity
Sub TestSub(ByVal X)  ' No type specified - leads to ambiguous type
    X = X + 1         ' What type of addition is this?
End Sub

' 7. Empty Array Parameter Ambiguity
Sub ProcessArray(Arr())   ' Empty array bounds
    ' Are we expecting 0-based or 1-based array?
    Dim i As Integer
    For i = 0 To UBound(Arr)  ' Which bound should we really start from?
    Next i
End Sub

' 8. Variant Type Ambiguity
Dim V As Variant
V = "123"            ' Is V now a String or a Variant containing a String?
V = V + 1           ' String concatenation or numeric addition?

' 9. Comparison Operator Ambiguity
If "123" > "99" Then ' String comparison or numeric comparison?
    ' Result differs based on comparison type
End If

' 10. Object Default Member Ambiguity
Private WithEvents MyControl As Control
' Later in code:
MyControl = 5        ' Setting which property? The default member is implicit

' 11. Implicit Type Conversion Ambiguity
Dim IntVar As Integer
Dim LngVar As Long
IntVar = 40000       ' Within Integer range
LngVar = IntVar * IntVar  ' Overflow or implicit conversion to Long?

' 12. Named Parameter Ambiguity
Sub TestProc(Optional X = 10)
End Sub
' Later:
Call TestProc(X:=20)  ' Is X a named parameter or a variable named X?

' 13. Collection/Array Ambiguity
Dim Arr(1 To 10)    ' Array
Dim Col As Collection ' Collection
' Later:
Debug.Print Col(1)   ' Using same syntax for different types of indexing

' 14. Date Literal Ambiguity
Dim D As Date
D = #1/2/2024#      ' Is this January 2nd or February 1st?

' 15. Numeric Precision Ambiguity
Dim A As Single
Dim B As Double
A = 1/3             ' Different precision than B = 1/3
B = 1/3             ' Which precision is used in mixed expressions?

' 16. Boolean Evaluation Ambiguity
If X = True Then    ' Is this evaluating X = True or just X?
End If

' 17. Like Operator Ambiguity
If "ABC" Like "A*"  ' Case sensitive or insensitive?
End If

' 18. Implicit Object Creation Ambiguity
Dim XL As Excel.Application
Set XL = CreateObject("Excel.Application")  ' Creates new or gets existing?

' 19. Array Base Ambiguity
Option Base 0  ' But what about arrays declared before this?
Dim Arr(10)   ' 0 to 10 or 1 to 10?

' 20. Type Conversion of Null Ambiguity
Dim N As Variant
N = Null
Dim S As String
S = N  ' Empty string or error?


'1. Default Form Instance Behavior
' VB6 automatically creates a default instance of forms
Form1.Show  ' Works without explicitly creating Form1
' Modern languages require explicit instantiation:
' Dim f As New Form1
' f.Show()

'2. Arrays and Collections Mixed Usage
Dim mixed(10) As Variant
mixed(1) = "String"
mixed(2) = 123
mixed(3) = New Collection
' Modern languages typically don't allow mixed types in arrays

'3. Optional Parameters with Omitted Arguments
Sub ProcessData(Optional str As String, Optional num As Integer)
    ' VB6 allows omitting arguments in the middle
    ProcessData(, 123)  ' First argument omitted
End Sub

'4. GoTo and Labels with Dynamic Logic
On Error GoTo ErrorHandler
On num GoTo Label1, Label2, Label3  ' Dynamic jumps
' Many modern languages don't support this style of flow control

'5. API Declaration Complexity
Private Declare Function GetWindowText Lib "user32" Alias "GetWindowTextA" _
    (ByVal hwnd As Long, _
     ByVal lpString As String, _
     ByVal cch As Long) As Long
' Different calling conventions and memory models

'6. Type Libraries and COM Interop
' VB6 heavily relies on COM and Type Libraries
Private WithEvents objExcel As Excel.Application
' Modern platforms handle COM differently

' VB6 allows dynamic control arrays
Load Text1(1)  ' Dynamically load control
Text1(1).Text = "New Control"
' Most modern frameworks don't have this concept

'8. Implicit Type Coercion
Dim str As String
str = 123  ' Implicit conversion
' Modern languages often require explicit conversion
' str = Convert.ToString(123)

rst.Fields("CustomerName") = "John"  ' Implicit .Value
' Modern languages require explicit property access

'10. Variant Type Usage

v = 123
v = #1/1/2024#
' No direct equivalent in many modern languages

'11. Event Binding Mechanics

    ' VB6 automatic event wireup
End Sub
' Modern languages need explicit event registration

'12. Currency Data Type
Dim money As Currency
money = 123.45  ' Special handling for financial calculations
' Not directly mappable to modern decimal types

'13. Fixed-Length String Declarations
Dim fixedStr As String * 10
' Most modern languages don't support fixed-length strings

'14. Module-level Variables and State
' In standard module:
Private mvarState As Integer

'15. Default Property Let/Get/Set
Property Let Value(val As Variant)
    ' VB6 special handling of default properties
End Property
' Different property patterns in modern languages

'16. Error Handling Patterns
On Error Resume Next
' Error occurred here but execution continues
If Err.Number <> 0 Then
    ' Handle error
End If
' Modern languages use try/catch blocks

'17. Parameter Array Implementation
Sub ProcessItems(ParamArray items() As Variant)
    ' VB6 specific implementation
End Sub
' Different syntax and handling in modern languages

'18. Collection Object Behavior
Dim col As New Collection
col.Add "Item", "Key"  ' VB6 specific collection behavior
' Modern collections work differently

'19. Implicit Form Controls
' VB6 forms automatically create member variables for controls
Text1.Text = "Hello"  ' No explicit declaration needed
' Modern frameworks require explicit declarations

'20. Data Type Marshalling
Private Type RECT
    Left As Long
    Top As Long
    Right As Long

'21. SendKeys and API Integration
SendKeys "%{F4}"  ' VB6 specific system interaction
' Different approaches needed in modern platforms

ChDrive "C:"
ChDir "C:\Temp"
