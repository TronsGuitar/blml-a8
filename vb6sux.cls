' PART 1: LANGUAGE AMBIGUITIES
'=============================================================================

'1. Keywords as Variable Names
' VB6 allows many keywords to be used as variable names if they're not reserved
Dim Error As Integer  ' "Error" is both a keyword and can be a variable name
Error = 100           ' Ambiguous: Is this setting the Error system object or the variable?

'2. Let keyword ambiguity
Dim Let As Integer    ' Let can be both a keyword and variable name
Let Let = 10         ' Highly ambiguous: Let statement or assignment to Let variable?
Let = 20             ' More ambiguity: Is this Let = 20 or implicit Let Let = 20?

'3. Type suffix character ambiguity
Dim A%               ' Integer using type suffix
Dim A As Integer     ' Same variable or different?
A% = 10              ' Which A is this referring to?

'4. Default Property Ambiguity
' Assuming we have a form with a textbox named "Text1"
Text1 = "Hello"      ' Is this Text1.Text or Text1.Value?
Print Text1          ' Will print the default property, but which one?

'5. Implicit Line Continuation Ambiguity
Dim MyString As String
MyString = "Hello" & _
"World"              ' Is this one line or two? VB6 treats differently

'6. Parameter Passing Ambiguity
Sub TestSub(ByVal X)  ' No type specified - leads to ambiguous type
    X = X + 1         ' What type of addition is this?
End Sub

'7. Empty Array Parameter Ambiguity
Sub ProcessArray(Arr())   ' Empty array bounds
    ' Are we expecting 0-based or 1-based array?
    Dim i As Integer
    For i = 0 To UBound(Arr)  ' Which bound should we really start from?
    Next i
End Sub

'8. Variant Type Ambiguity
Dim V As Variant
V = "123"            ' Is V now a String or a Variant containing a String?
V = V + 1           ' String concatenation or numeric addition?

'9. Comparison Operator Ambiguity
If "123" > "99" Then ' String comparison or numeric comparison?
    ' Result differs based on comparison type
End If

'10. Object Default Member Ambiguity
Private WithEvents MyControl As Control
' Later in code:
MyControl = 5        ' Setting which property? The default member is implicit

'=============================================================================
' PART 2: PORTING CHALLENGES
'=============================================================================

'11. Default Form Instance Behavior
' VB6 automatically creates a default instance of forms
Form1.Show  ' Works without explicitly creating Form1
' Modern languages require explicit instantiation:
' Dim f As New Form1
' f.Show()

'12. Arrays and Collections Mixed Usage
Dim mixed(10) As Variant
mixed(1) = "String"
mixed(2) = 123
mixed(3) = New Collection
' Modern languages typically don't allow mixed types in arrays

'13. Optional Parameters with Omitted Arguments
Sub ProcessData(Optional str As String, Optional num As Integer)
    ' VB6 allows omitting arguments in the middle
    ProcessData(, 123)  ' First argument omitted
End Sub

'14. GoTo and Labels with Dynamic Logic
On Error GoTo ErrorHandler
On num GoTo Label1, Label2, Label3  ' Dynamic jumps
' Many modern languages don't support this style of flow control

'15. API Declaration Complexity
Private Declare Function GetWindowText Lib "user32" Alias "GetWindowTextA" _
    (ByVal hwnd As Long, _
     ByVal lpString As String, _
     ByVal cch As Long) As Long
' Different calling conventions and memory models

'16. Type Libraries and COM Interop
' VB6 heavily relies on COM and Type Libraries
Private WithEvents objExcel As Excel.Application
' Modern platforms handle COM differently

'17. Control Arrays
' VB6 allows dynamic control arrays
Load Text1(1)  ' Dynamically load control
Text1(1).Text = "New Control"
' Most modern frameworks don't have this concept

'18. Default Properties of Objects
Dim rst As ADODB.Recordset
rst.Fields("CustomerName") = "John"  ' Implicit .Value
' Modern languages require explicit property access

'19. Fixed-Length String Declarations
Dim fixedStr As String * 10
' Most modern languages don't support fixed-length strings

'20. Module-level Variables and State
' In standard module:
Private mvarState As Integer
' Global state handling differs in modern languages

'21. Default Property Let/Get/Set
Property Let Value(val As Variant)
    ' VB6 special handling of default properties
End Property
' Different property patterns in modern languages

'22. Error Handling Patterns
On Error Resume Next
' Error occurred here but execution continues
If Err.Number <> 0 Then
    ' Handle error
End If
' Modern languages use try/catch blocks

'23. Parameter Array Implementation
Sub ProcessItems(ParamArray items() As Variant)
    ' VB6 specific implementation
End Sub
' Different syntax and handling in modern languages

'24. Collection Object Behavior
Dim col As New Collection
col.Add "Item", "Key"  ' VB6 specific collection behavior
' Modern collections work differently

'25. Implicit Form Controls
' VB6 forms automatically create member variables for controls
Text1.Text = "Hello"  ' No explicit declaration needed
' Modern frameworks require explicit declarations

'26. Data Type Marshalling
Private Type RECT
    Left As Long
    Top As Long
    Right As Long
    Bottom As Long
End Type
' Structure marshalling differs across platforms

'27. SendKeys and API Integration
SendKeys "%{F4}"  ' VB6 specific system interaction
' Different approaches needed in modern platforms

'28. Clipboard Handling
Clipboard.SetText "Text"  ' VB6 specific
' Modern platforms use different clipboard APIs

'29. Printer Object
Printer.Print "Direct printing"  ' VB6 specific
' Modern platforms use different printing frameworks

'30. Screen Object Usage
Screen.MousePointer = vbHourglass
' Different screen/display handling in modern platforms

'=============================================================================
' PART 3: ADDITIONAL COMPLEXITIES
'=============================================================================

'31. Environment and File System
ChDrive "C:"
ChDir "C:\Temp"
' System interaction differs in modern platforms

'32. DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange)
LinkPoke LinkItem, "New Value"
' Obsolete technology, needs modern replacement

'33. OLE Automation
' VB6 specific OLE handling
Dim obj As Object
Set obj = CreateObject("Word.Application")
' Different automation patterns in modern platforms

'34. Control Positioning
Form1.Move 100, 100  ' VB6 specific
' Different coordinate systems and positioning in modern UI frameworks

'35. Date Handling Ambiguity
Dim D As Date
D = #1/2/2024#      ' Is this January 2nd or February 1st?
' Date interpretation varies by regional settings

'36. Numeric Precision Issues
Dim A As Single
Dim B As Double
A = 1/3             ' Different precision than B = 1/3
B = 1/3             ' Which precision is used in mixed expressions?

'37. Boolean Evaluation Edge Cases
If X = True Then    ' Is this evaluating X = True or just X?
End If
If X Then           ' Implicit boolean conversion

'38. Like Operator Behavior
If "ABC" Like "A*"  ' Case sensitive or insensitive?
' Depends on Option Compare setting

'39. Implicit Object Creation
Dim XL As Excel.Application
Set XL = CreateObject("Excel.Application")  ' Creates new or gets existing?

'40. Array Base Issues
Option Base 0  ' But what about arrays declared before this?
Dim Arr(10)   ' 0 to 10 or 1 to 10?

' Key Implications for Automated Porting:
' 1. Context-dependent analysis required
' 2. Multiple valid interpretations of same code
' 3. Platform-specific features need reimplementation
' 4. Runtime behavior may differ
' 5. Type system differences require transformation
' 6. UI framework conversion needed
' 7. System interaction patterns need modernization
' 8. Error handling requires restructuring
