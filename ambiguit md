How to determine the context of ambiguous unreserved keywords?

Look at the encompassing scope through the parsed tokens  Look backwards 
If a keyword has correct syntax it will not be a declared variable, parameter or property  

Create a local register when parsing. Register when a token is unreserved and declared.

Blockchain may be the answer because we traverse the chain of tokens back to see if it has been validated as a variavariable, parameter or property. 

To get this right we should add all references, public properties and functions to the ledger so as to determine if an unreserved keyword is overloaded.
