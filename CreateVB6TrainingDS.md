1. Understanding the Purpose

Before creating the dataset, it's important to understand what you're aiming to achieve:

Language Modeling: Training an LLM to understand and generate VB6 code.

Code Completion: Enabling the model to predict the next lines of code.

Syntax Understanding: Helping the model learn VB6 syntax and semantics.



---

2. Collecting VB6 Code Samples

2.1. Open-Source Repositories

While VB6 is an older language, there are still repositories and resources where you can find VB6 code:

GitHub Search:

Use advanced search queries to find repositories with VB6 code.

Example: GitHub Advanced Search

Set the language to "Visual Basic".

Note: "Visual Basic" on GitHub may include VB.NET code, so you'll need to filter manually.



SourceForge:

A platform hosting many legacy projects.

Search for VB6 projects: SourceForge VB6 Projects



2.2. Public Code Archives

CodeProject:

A community for developers where VB6 code snippets and projects are shared.

VB6 Articles


Planet Source Code:

Hosts a large number of VB6 code samples.

VB6 Code Snippets



2.3. Personal Codebase

If you have access to VB6 projects you've worked on, you can include them in your dataset, provided you have the rights to use them.


2.4. Web Scraping

Automated Collection:

Use web scraping tools to collect code snippets from forums or websites.

Be cautious and comply with the website's terms of service.

3. Ethical and Legal Considerations

3.1. Licensing

Open-Source Licenses:

Review the licenses of any open-source code you collect.

Permissive licenses (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0) are more flexible.

Avoid code with restrictive licenses (e.g., GPL) unless your use case complies with their terms.



3.2. Copyright

Respect Intellectual Property:

Do not include proprietary or copyrighted code without permission.

Ensure you have the rights to use and distribute the code in your dataset.



3.3. Privacy

Sensitive Information:

Remove any hard-coded credentials, personal data, or sensitive information from the code samples.




---

4. Preprocessing the Data

4.1. Cleaning the Code

Consistent Encoding:

Ensure all files are encoded in UTF-8 to avoid encoding issues.


Remove Unwanted Data:

Strip out unnecessary comments or metadata if not needed.

Remove any non-code content (e.g., documentation in non-code files).



4.2. Organizing the Data

Directory Structure:

Organize code files into directories if needed, based on project or functionality.


File Extensions:

Standard VB6 file extensions include .vbp (project files), .frm (form files), .bas (module files), .cls (class files).



4.3. Normalizing Code

Formatting:

Use code formatters to standardize indentation and spacing.

This helps the model focus on code patterns rather than formatting differences.


Tokenization:

Decide whether to tokenize code at this stage or let the model's tokenizer handle it.

For LLMs, it's common to feed raw code and rely on the tokenizer during training.




---

5. Formatting the Dataset

5.1. Plain Text Files

Concatenated Code:

Combine code files into large text files, separating them with special tokens if desired.


Example:

' --- File Start ---
Sub Example()
    MsgBox "Hello, World!"
End Sub
' --- File End ---


5.2. JSON Format

Structured Data:

Use JSON lines (.jsonl) format if you want to include metadata.


Example:

{"code": "Sub Example()\n    MsgBox \"Hello, World!\"\nEnd Sub", "filename": "example.bas"}


5.3. CSV Format

Tabular Data:

Not commonly used for code but can be utilized if appropriate.



5.4. Special Tokens

Separators:

Use unique tokens to separate different code snippets or files.

Example:

<|file_separator|>
Sub FirstExample()
    ' Code here
End Sub
<|file_separator|>
Sub SecondExample()
    ' Code here
End Sub

6. Tools and Resources

6.1. Web Scraping Tools

Beautiful Soup (Python):

For parsing HTML and extracting code snippets.

Beautiful Soup Documentation


Selenium:

Automate web browsers to scrape dynamic content.

Selenium Documentation



6.2. Code Formatters and Linters

VB6 Code Formatter:

Tools like VB Beautify can format VB6 code.



6.3. Data Processing Libraries

Python Libraries:

pandas for handling structured data.

json module for JSON operations.

os and glob for file operations.

7. Example Workflow

Step 1: Collect Code Files

Using GitHub API:

Use the GitHub API to search and download repositories tagged with VB6.

Python example:

import requests

headers = {'Accept': 'application/vnd.github.v3+json'}
query = 'language:"Visual Basic 6"'
url = f'https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q={query}'

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
data = response.json()
repositories = data['items']



Step 2: Download and Extract Code

Clone Repositories:

Use git clone to download repositories.

Alternatively, download as ZIP files.


Extract Code Files:

Use glob to find files with VB6 extensions.

import glob

vb6_files = glob.glob('**/*.bas', recursive=True)
vb6_files += glob.glob('**/*.frm', recursive=True)
vb6_files += glob.glob('**/*.cls', recursive=True)



Step 3: Preprocess Code

Read and Clean Files:

code_snippets = []

for file_path in vb6_files:
    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8', errors='ignore') as file:
        code = file.read()
        # Optional: Remove comments or unwanted sections
        code_snippets.append(code)


Step 4: Format Dataset

Create a Single Text File:

with open('vb6_dataset.txt', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as outfile:
    for code in code_snippets:
        outfile.write('<|file_separator|>\n')
        outfile.write(code)
        outfile.write('\n')

Or Create JSONL File:

import json

with open('vb6_dataset.jsonl', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as outfile:
    for code in code_snippets:
        json.dump({'code': code}, outfile)
        outfile.write('\n')


Step 5: Verify and Clean Dataset

Check for Errors:

Ensure there are no encoding issues.

Remove any empty or invalid code snippets.


Data Balance:

Verify that the dataset has a good variety of code (e.g., different functions, classes).

8. Additional Tips

8.1. Data Augmentation

Code Variants:

Introduce minor variations in the code to increase diversity.

Be cautious not to introduce syntax errors.



8.2. Comment Handling

Including Comments:

Keeping comments can help the model learn to generate code with appropriate documentation.


Removing Comments:

If focusing purely on code structure, you may choose to remove comments.



8.3. Syntax Highlighting

Not Needed for Text Input:

Syntax highlighting is a feature of code editors and is not necessary for the dataset.



8.4. Validation Set

Split Dataset:

Reserve a portion of your dataset (e.g., 10%) for validation purposes during training.

9. Conclusion

Creating a training dataset for VB6 involves careful collection and preparation of code samples. By following the steps outlined above, you'll be able to assemble a dataset suitable for training language models to understand and generate VB6 code.


---

Next Steps

Model Training:

Use the prepared dataset to fine-tune an existing LLM, such as a smaller LLaMA model or another suitable architecture.


Evaluation:

Test the model's ability to generate VB6 code snippets and assess its performance.


Iteration:

Based on results, you may need to collect more data or further preprocess your dataset.
